## C++
- `Explicitly` have to deallocate memory if memory allocated using malloc, or new keyword.

- In C++, everything is allocated on **Stack**, until unless **new** keyword is used for object or memory allocation in which case happens on **Heap**.



## Java
- **Implicit memory management**.

- **Instance methods** : In Java, we do not have separate copies for instance methods. The way this is done is by passing an implied reference to this.


## Javascript
- **Implicit memory management**.
- 


## Python
- **Implicit memory management**



## Go
+ **Implicit memory management**
+ Go manages the heap memory by garbage collection. 
+ In simple terms, it frees the memory used by orphan objects, i.e, objects that are no longer referenced from the Stack directly or indirectly(via a reference in another object) to make space for new object creation.
+ As of version 1.12, the Golang uses a non-generational concurrent tri-color mark and sweep collector


## Rust
+ Rust Lang Compiler is written in Rust.
    ```
    This is called self-hosting or bootstrapping. 
    The basic idea goes like this:

    + Write an initial compiler for a small subset of Rust using your Other   Programming Language of Choice.
    + You now have compiler C0.
    + Using the subset of Rust you have a compiler for, rewrite the source for C0 purely in Rust. Compile that program using compiler C0 to form compiler C1.
    + Add features to Rust by adding code to the compiler you just wrote to properly parse and implement those features. Compile that Rust program with C1 to form compiler C2.
    + By repeating step (3) as many times as youâ€™d like, you can add progressively more and more features to the Rust language, with the Rust compiler always being written in Rust itself.
    ```

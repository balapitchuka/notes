### Types Of Software Testing:

- **Unit Testing** 
   - It focuses on testing smallest unit of software design. Eg: a function etc.
   - Tests single units of functionality in isolation hence call **unittesting**
- **Integration Testing** 
   - Integration testing is testing in which a group of components are combined to produce output.
   - Examples:
      - (a) **Black Box testing**:- It is used for **validation**. 
        In this we ignores internal working mechanism and 
        focuses on **what is the output?.**

       - (b) **White Box testing**:- It is used for **verification**. 
         In this we focus on internal mechanism i.e.
         **how the output is achieved?**
- **Regression Testing**
- **Smoke Testing**
- **Alpha Testing**
- **Beta Testing**
- **System Testing** 
- **Stress Testing**
- **Performance Testing**

### TTD (Test Driven Development)
- Tests drive the code
   - **Red (Test fails) -> Green(Test passes) -> Refactor (Code and Tests)**
- Involves following steps
   - 1. A new test will initially fail.
   - 2. We work and write application code to get the test pass.
   - 3. We finally optimize our code and tests

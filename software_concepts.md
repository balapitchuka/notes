Consists of :
- Software Architecture
- Software Requirements
- Software Development
- Software Testing

### Ways to increase computing power
1. Increase the clock speed of processor.
   - Increases the heat dissipation, thereby decreasing the performance per watt and moreover, this requires special
     equipment for cooling.
2. Increase the number of processing cores on the chip.
   - Feasible solution

### multithreading, multiprocessing, multitasking, multiprogramming
> **multitasking** : doing multiple tasks at a same time.

### scalable

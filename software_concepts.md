Consists of :
- Software Architecture
- Software Requirements
- Software Development
- Software Testing

### Ways to increase computing power
1. Increase the clock speed of processor.
   - Increases the heat dissipation, thereby decreasing the performance per watt and moreover, this requires special
     equipment for cooling.
2. Increase the number of processing cores on the chip.
   - Feasible solution

### multithreading, multiprocessing, multitasking, multiprogramming
> **multitasking** : doing multiple tasks at a same time.

### scalable
```
 ability of a process, network, software or organization to grow and manage increased demand
```

## Software Testing

- Unit Testing 
   - It focuses on testing smallest unit of software design. Eg: a function etc.

- Integration Testing 
   - Integration testing is testing in which a group of components are combined to produce output.
   - Examples:
      - (a) **Black Box testing**:- It is used for **validation**. 
        In this we ignores internal working mechanism and 
        focuses on **what is the output?.**

       - (b) **White Box testing**:- It is used for **verification**. 
         In this we focus on internal mechanism i.e.
         **how the output is achieved?**

-  Regression Testing 
   - 
- Smoke Testing

- Alpha Testing 
- Beta Testing 
- System Testing

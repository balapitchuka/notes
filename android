## Hybrid vs Native Mobile Apps 

Hybrid App
- A hybrid app is built using HTML and CSS. Since these apps are browser based, they require a browser to work and that is where the Webview (browser activity) comes in. Hybrid mobile apps use Webview for their User Interface. 

Native Mobile App
- On the other hand, a native mobile app uses the native Software Development Kit (SDK) for its development. You can also say that a native mobile app is developed for a particular mobile operating system.

Logging is one of the most useful tools in a code writer's toolkit. All too often, people get in the habit of using print statements to debug their code. While convenient, this causes a few problems. Firstly, what happens when you are done debugging? You now have to go back and remove all these print statements. If you forget one, you could be exposing potentially sensitive information or just generally cluttering up your user's screen with unnecesssary information.

### MEAN Stack:
- The MEAN stack is comprised of four technologies: MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js,
- free open source stack to build web apps
- is one of the best tools available for solving contemporary business challenges.

1. The client first interacts with the user interface, which is built using the Angular frontend framework. 
2. Requests made on the interface are passed to Node.js, the server-side engine. 
3. Then, the middleware framework known as Express.js makes a request to MongoDB, which is the database. 
4. Express.js retrieves the response in the form of data from the database. 
5. Finally, this response is then returned by Node.js to the client via the user display

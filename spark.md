After google published these papers, open source community liked the ideas very much and that formed the basis for the design and development of similar open source implementation
- HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
  - Distriubted file system over a cluster of computer/nodes
  - Helps us to combine storage capacity of hundreds of computers and use it as a unified storage system
- Hadoop MapReduce
  - Distributed processing over and above HDFS 

Because of this popularity of Hadoop, many other solutions are developed on the top of Hadoop and open sourced by many organisations
Examples:
- Pig
- Hive
- Spark

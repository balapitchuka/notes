# Spark


## Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD)
- RDD is a data abstraction over the distributed collection
- RDDs are immutable; therefore, changing the RDD is impossible

RDD Creation
- An RDD is created using various functions defined in the SparkContext class. 
- One important method for creating an RDD is parallelize()


Operations On RDD
- transformation
- action
